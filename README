This repo contains scripts to manage jailed SFTP users with
username and password authentification (SSH).

You will need to run the `initialize` script that will make 
sure the server is configured correctly to create and allow 
the jailed users to connect from a `sftpusers` group.

./initialize 

Use `create_user` to create new jailed users on the server.

./create_user <username> <password>

This will give them access to their own jailed directory 
at /home/<username>/data

Use `delete_user` to delete users from the server.

./delete_user <username>
